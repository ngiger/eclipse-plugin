h1. Eclipse::Plugin

A Ruby Gem to extract information about views, properties and perspectives from an eclipse plugin or a workspace

Use it at your own risk, as it is just a small utility gem to help for some release engineering for the Elexis-RCP. See http://elexis.info.

But I have an open ear for suggestions for improvements, especially if they come with a patch including specs.

h2. Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'eclipse-plugin'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install eclipse-plugin

h2. Usage

  require 'eclipse/plugin'
  workspace =  Eclipse::Workspace.new('/path/to/eclipse/app')
  workspace.parsePluginDir
  workspace.views.first {|view| puts view.id }

Or you can inspire you from the spec/*_spec.rb files to see tested examples.
