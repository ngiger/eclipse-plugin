h1. Eclipse::Plugin

A Ruby Gem to extract information about views, properties and perspectives from an eclipse plugin or a workspace

Use it at your own risk, as it is just a small utility gem to help for some release engineering for the Elexis-RCP. See http://elexis.info.

But I have an open ear for suggestions for improvements, especially if they come with a patch including specs.
